Intro:
In this project, we solve classification problems using neural networks and genetic algorithms. 
We implemented an automatic pipeline to both determine the optimal neural network's architecture (bonus) and its neurpn's weights.
The project solved the suggested classifivcation problems pretty easily and accuratly.
The project was written in Python3.9.


Execution Steps:
	1. git clone https://github.com/BenNageris/CompBioEx3
	2. Move To Directory: cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>\output\<EXECUTOR>
		2.1. <EXECUTOR> is one of:
			2.1.1. build_architecture<0/1>
			2.1.2. buildnet<0/1>
			2.1.3. runnet<0/1>: runnet<0/1> execution output is to output-testnet<0/1>
	3. Execution: <EXECUTOR>.exe
		for example: if you are at output\build_architecture0 you will have to execute: .\build_architecture1.exe
		or, if you are at output\buildnet0 you will have to execute: .\buildnet0.exe

(*) We tested this program on a Windows PC with python3.9 installed.
