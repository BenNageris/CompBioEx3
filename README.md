Intro:
In this project, we solve classification problems using neural networks and genetic algorithms. 
We implemented an automatic pipeline to both determine the optimal neural network's architecture (bonus) and its neurpn's weights.
The project solved the suggested classifivcation problems pretty easily and accuratly.
The project was written in Python3.9.


Execution Steps:
	1. git clone https://github.com/BenNageris/CompBioEx3
	2. cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
	3. 


(*) We tested this program on a Windows PC & Linux Ubuntu with Python 3.10 & python3.9 installed.
